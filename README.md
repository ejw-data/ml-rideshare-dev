## Overview  
<hr>  

This repo has been repurposed.  It was originally a flask app that used a pre-trained machine learning model to predict rideshare trip costs.  The original repository that contains files from all contributors can be found in the repo named [machine_learning-ridesharing_data](https://github.com/atomazos/machine_learning-ridesharing_data). That repo contains the files used to develop the flask app, machine learning, and website graphics.  This repo only contains files developed by Erin Wills and his development of his own data extraction and machine learning techniques.
